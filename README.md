# Pacman2

Things to fix:
- record manager
- timer at start of level and when losing a life (3 2 1 start)
- ghost movement algorithms (Clyde)
- game over and level complete (right now the console just prints something)
    - dialog message box (like pipes)
    - update high score
    - close game window
- change "background-color = white" to "background-image = food.jpg" in game window --> i'm thinking we leave pacman and ghost as is, but change food to be a dark blue square with yellow dot at the middle and empty square to be dark blue square with nothing.
